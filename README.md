# A Simple Tweet Preview

**A Simple Tweet Preview** is a web application designed to help users preview how their tweets, including text and up to four images, will look before posting them on Twitter. This tool addresses the issue with Twitter's current compose feature, which doesn't accurately display media layouts, ensuring that the visual arrangement of images is as intended.

## Features

- **Input Fields**: Enter tweet text and username.
- **Image Upload**: Add up to four images via drag-and-drop or file selection.
- **Real-Time Preview**: See a live preview of the tweet, including profile picture, username, text, and media layout.
- **Image Reordering**: Reorder images using drag-and-drop.
- **Theme Support**: Switch between light and dark themes with persistent settings.
- **Export Options**: Export the media collage or full tweet preview as PNG images.
- **PWA Functionality**: Install the app for offline use and a native-like experience.
